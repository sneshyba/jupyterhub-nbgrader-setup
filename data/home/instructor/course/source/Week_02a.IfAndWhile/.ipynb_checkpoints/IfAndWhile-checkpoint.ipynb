    "## \"If\" blocks\n",
    "Lots of times in climate modeling, we want to check whether some condition is met before going ahead. Python does this with an *if* block, which looks like \n",
    "\n",
    "    if (some condition is met):\n",
    "        line1\n",
    "        line2\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "This is not actually Python code -- it's what we call *pseudo code* because it's supposed to be a little more intuitive than actual code$^*$. The point for now is, the entire set (\"block\") of indented commands line1, line2, ... will be executed only if that condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "$*$That said, some people refer to Python as \"executable pseudo code.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## \"While\" loops\n",
    "A similar situation also arises when we want to do something over and over again, like march our climate model forward over time, and make that *also* contingent on meeting some kind of condition. That kind of thing calls for a *loop*. Among the many ways to set up a loop, the one we'll explore here is called a *while* loop (sometimes referred to as a *pre-test loop*). It looks a lot like the *if* syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (some condition is met):\n",
    "        line1\n",
    "        line2\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "only now, those lines will be executed over and over again. If we've set things up right, the condition eventually stops being true, and we exit from the loop. *while* loops often require a little more setup, and are often followed by more reporting, than *if* statements -- but we'll talk about that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Emergency exits\n",
    "An emergency exit from a loop is a kind of failsafe that you build into your loop, in case something goes wrong and the condition you thought would terminate the loop is never met. Yeah, maybe your loop will never trigger it, but everybody makes mistakes (that's why we call it an *emergency* exit). In this exercise, you'll be equipping a *while* loop with an emergency exit using a *nested if block* -- i.e., an *if* condition that's *inside* the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "1. Become familiar with the syntax of \"if\" blocks and \"while\" loops.\n",
    "1. Set up emergency exits from \"while\" loops. \n",
    "1. Use lists to accumulate information from each iteration of a loop.\n",
    "1. Be able to query the last few elements of a list, even if you don't know the length of the list."
