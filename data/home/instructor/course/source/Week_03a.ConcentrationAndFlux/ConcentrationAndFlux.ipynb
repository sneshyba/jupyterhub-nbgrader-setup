That's the mass of Carbon in the atmosphere in the year described by the figure. A second appears in the center of the figure, the red-colored value labeled \"human emissions\" -- $9$ (units: $GtC/year$). That's the anthropogenic emission amount in the year described by the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we'll be focusing on here is, what year does this figure describe? To answer that, we'll need measured atmospheric carbon concentrations -- such as the Mauna Loa measurements available at https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/graph.html, and emissions -- such as the graphics shown at https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions.\n",

    "- To convert parts-per-million (ppm) of $CO_2$ to $GtC$ in Earth's atmosphere, multiply by 2.123 (see https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/2793/2013/acp-13-2793-2013-supplement.pdf).\n",
    "- To convert $GtC$ to $GtCO_2$, multiply by 3.667.\n",
    "- In each case, to convert the other way round, you would divide by the conversion factor.\n",
    "- These conversion factors also work for fluxes (like converting $GtC/year$ to $GtCO_2/year$).\n",

    "1. To familiarize yourself with Global Carbon Cycle values.\n",
    "1. Be able to convert concentrations of carbon in Earth's climate reservoirs, and fluxes among them."
